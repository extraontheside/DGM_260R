Maya has a timeline feature that views the animation of the project that is open. There is a play, pause, next / back keyframe, 
step forward / back one key frame, and start / end button next to the timeline. Adding frames and deleting frames is easy by typing 
the amount or sliding the number. There are two boxes on each end of the timeline. The outer boxes is the maximum frames the 
animation has. The inner boxes are the number of frames that want to view in the timeline. Navigating the timeline also has keyboard 
shortcuts. You can adjust the speed of animation by setting preferences. You can also adjust the playback preferences. In the playback 
preferences, you can view the animation in all views when you press space bar, and you can choose to select one view port to play the 
animation while the other three are stationary. You can adjust playback start and end. Also, you can adjust the animation start and end. 
The playback preference can loop the animation, loop once, and loop forward and back of the animation. In real time, the human eyes 
view twenty-four frames per second. In Maya, you can adjust the speed of frames per second.
